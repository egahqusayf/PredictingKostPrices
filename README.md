## Implementation of the Random Forest Algorithm for Predicting Rental Prices in Surabaya City

The project "Implementation of the Random Forest Algorithm for Predicting Kost Rental Prices in Surabaya City" aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast rental prices for boarding houses (kos) in Surabaya. By using the Random Forest algorithm, which is known for its robustness and high accuracy in predictive tasks, this project analyzes various features that influence rental prices, such as location, room facilities, and other amenities. The goal is to provide a reliable tool for both property owners and tenants to make informed decisions based on market trends and data-driven insights. This project also seeks to enhance the understanding of factors affecting rental prices, enabling a more strategic approach in the real estate market of Surabaya
